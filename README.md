- **Phishing Email Domain**: `info@lndeed.com`
  ![6a279931-c0f9-45ad-8648-43251ebec248](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a736015c-5c64-4c26-ae54-66b3a15c96b3)

- **Malicious IP Addresses**: `192.168.1.100`, `192.168.1.25`, `10.0.0.2`
- **Malicious Files**: `unknown.exe` found at `C:\Program Files (x86)\UnknownApp\`
- **Unauthorized Access Events**: Multiple failed and successful login attempts observed.

### Root Cause Analysis
The attack originated from a successful phishing attempt, which led to malware installation and lateral movement due to inadequate email filtering and phishing awareness.

### Nature of the Attack
- **Attack Vectors**: Phishing, Privilege Escalation, Lateral Movement
- **Techniques**: Spoofing, Brute-Force Attempts, Malware Deployment

**Color-Coded Chart of Attack Techniques**:  
- **Red**: Initial Compromise (Phishing Email)
- **Yellow**: Escalation of Privileges (Malware Deployment)
- **Orange**: Lateral Movement (Attempted Network Spread)

## 3. Impact Analysis
The attack led to impaired system functionality, although no confirmed data exfiltration occurred. Downtime and potential data exposure were key risks.

- **Patients**: Potential risk to Personal Health Information (PHI)
- **IT Teams**: Increased pressure during mitigation
- **Leadership**: Regulatory and reputational risks

## 4. Response and Recovery Analysis

### Immediate Response Actions (22 Hours)
- **Isolation**: Affected systems were isolated to prevent spread.
- **Logout**: All active users were logged out.

### Eradication Measures (48 Hours)
- **Malware Removal**: `unknown.exe` removed from all affected systems.
- **Password Resets**: Reset credentials for compromised accounts.

### Recovery Steps (65 Hours)
- **System Reimaging**: Systems were reimaged to ensure complete removal of threats.
- **Database Recovery**: `mydatabase.mdf` was restored from a secure backup.

**Recovery Timeline** (Color-Coded):
- Containment (22 Hours)
- Eradication (48 Hours)
- Recovery (65 Hours)

## 5. MITRE ATT&CK Framework Analysis
The attack phases mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework:

1. **Initial Access** (TA0001):  
   - **Phishing** (T1566) - A phishing email was used for gaining initial access.
2. **Execution** (TA0002):  
   - **User Execution** (T1204) - The user clicked on the malicious link leading to execution.
3. **Persistence** (TA0003):  
   - **Create Account** (T1136) - Accounts were compromised and utilized for persistence.
4. **Privilege Escalation** (TA0004):  
   - **Valid Accounts** (T1078) - Use of stolen credentials to escalate privileges.
5. **Lateral Movement** (TA0008):  
   - **Remote Services** (T1021) - The attacker moved laterally through the network using remote services.

**Chart: MITRE ATT&CK Phases Impacted**  
- **Initial Access**: 100%  
- **Execution**: 75%  
- **Persistence**: 50%  
- **Privilege Escalation**: 50%  
- **Lateral Movement**: 25%

## 6. Cyber Kill Chain Breakdown
The Cyber Kill Chain stages for this attack are as follows:

1. **Reconnaissance**: The attacker sent phishing emails to potential victims.
2. **Weaponization**: The attacker prepared the phishing email with a malicious link.
3. **Delivery**: The phishing email was delivered to `john.doe@mavenclinic.com`.
4. **Exploitation**: John Doe clicked the link, leading to the installation of malware.
5. **Installation**: The malware (`unknown.exe`) was installed on DESKTOP-1234567.
6. **Command and Control**: The attacker attempted to establish a control channel for data exfiltration.
7. **Actions on Objectives**: The attacker moved laterally and attempted to escalate privileges.
